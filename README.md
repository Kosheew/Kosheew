## 🎮 **Projects** 

### 🔹  [Agency](https://github.com/Kosheew/Agency-HDRP.git)

Agency is a dark spy thriller set in a divided city inspired by 1980s Berlin. You play as an undercover agent navigating a world of political tension, surveillance, and secrets. The story unfolds through exploration, stealth, and meaningful dialogue choices, where every decision can shift the balance of power.

**Gameplay Features:
- Cover-based stealth system: Hide behind objects to avoid enemy detection.
- Line-of-sight AI: Enemies detect the player only when visible and not behind cover.
- Dialogue with branching choices: Influence the outcome of events and relationships.
- Evidence investigation: Search environments for key clues to progress the story.

**Technical Implementation
- AI System: FSM-based enemy behavior (patrolling, searching, attacking), with plans for Behavior Trees in future iterations.
- Dialogue System: Built with ScriptableObjects, using custom editor with node-based visual layout (no third-party tools).
- Save System: Modular save/load using interfaces (ISaveManager) with Binary and JSON support. Storage limits tied to building levels.
